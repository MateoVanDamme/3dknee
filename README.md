### Visualisation 
The visualization script is based on by the [texture3d](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=texture3d#webgl_texture3d) example from Three.js. 

### Datasets

One of the datasets called ``stent.nrrd`` is a 3D volume converted from ``stent.npz`` from the imageio project.
It is a volumetric image showing a stented abdominal aorta. It is in the public domain.
